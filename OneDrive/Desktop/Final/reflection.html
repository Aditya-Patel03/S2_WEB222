        <h2>Final Assessment - Reflection</h2>
        <p>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Responsive design is a GUI design (Graphical User Interface) approach used to create content that can adjust according to their screen size smoothly.</li>
            <li>Designers can resize elements in relative units and apply media requests/queries  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The Responsive design has three vital components/principles:</li>
            <li> 1.<b>Fluid Grid System</b>: Elements occupy the same percentage of space regardless of the screen size. </li>
            <li> 2.<b>Fluid Image Use</b>: Images aren't fluid by nature. This results the design having inconsistency across devices as default images will fail to adjust and hence display is out of proportion. To solve this we can use img {max-width: 100%;} in css file.</li>
            <li> 3.<b>Media Queries</b>: Filters used to detect browsing device's dimensions to make the design appear nicely. These can alter the size layout to meet certain requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Web apps are built using Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Python. Unlike Mobile applications we are not required to have any standard development kit. Although developers need to access templates. Web apps are considered to be built quicker and easier. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course. </p>

            Overall, I had a great time with the course as it showed me the creative side of programming.
            The Javascript concepts were a bit tricky to understand, as we had to observe the code side by side with the output.
            In Contradiction to this, I had a lot of fun designing the websites with my unique ideas. The thing that bothered me with
            HTML coding was that I wasn't able to understand the inspect option in the browser at first.
            I still can't understand it that well but I am practicing. I am delighted to learn this language as I got a basic understanding of what web designing looks like.
            This course was based to explain to us the basics of web designing, hence I have a lot more to learn about web designing and to widen my knowledge about it.
